GAME CLIENT: https://tintin.mudhalla.net/

GAME SCRIPT: https://sourceforge.net/projects/artt/files/latest/download

Abandoned Realms is a roleplaying enforced, playerkilling encouraged
MUD.  This is not a world you will spend your time in alone.  There
will be many other adventurers you run into, in the lands.  Some of
these adventurers will become your greatest allies.  Others will be
enemies, who you may well be living in fear of.  These are real people,
and they will have ambitions and goals just like you.  The people are
what give Abandoned Realms its charm and make this a real experience.
